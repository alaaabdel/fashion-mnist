# Toy with FASHION-MNIST Dataset

- Played with softmax logitic regression, `SGDClassifier`, Random Forest, XGBoost for classifying the fashion-mnist dataset
- Also used `keras` 
	-  Densely connected neural network for classification
	- Used a convolutional nueral network (CNN) 
	- Used a CNN with dropout for reducing overfitting
	- Used data augumentation for further improvement
	- Used a pretrained model (VGG16) for still furhter improving the performance

## Todo

- [] Practice with `tensorflow` for all the models in `keras`
- [] Implement all the models in `pytorch`
- [] Try to use `capslueNet`
